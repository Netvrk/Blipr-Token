## **Audit Details**

### **1. Contract Overview**

- **Token Name**: AI Silk
- **Token Symbol**: AISK
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 tokens
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Libraries Used**:
  - OpenZeppelin's ERC20Upgradeable
  - AccessControlUpgradeable
  - UUPSUpgradeable
  - ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable

The contract introduces configurable taxes, transaction limits, role-based access control, and liquidity management.

### **2. Key Features**

#### **Launch Process**

- The `launch` function allows adding liquidity to a Uniswap pair and marking the token as launched.
- The `isLaunched` flag prevents trading before launch, mitigating risks of early trades or manipulation.
- Taxes and limits are pre-configured before the launch.

#### **Transfer Process**

- The `_update` function governs all transfers, implementing:
  - Tax deduction for buy, sell, and transfer operations.
  - Transaction and wallet size limits.
- Taxes are credited to the contract and can be swapped to ETH for operational purposes.

---

### **3. Security Features**

#### **Role-Based Access Control**

- The contract uses OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` to manage administrative roles:
  - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Full administrative control.
  - `MANAGER_ROLE`: Control over operational settings.
  - `UPGRADER_ROLE`: Authority to upgrade the contract.

#### **Reentrancy Protection**

- Critical functions (`launch`, `manualSwap`, `withdrawStuckTokens`) are protected by OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`.

#### **Front-Running Protection**

- The `isLaunched` flag ensures that trading cannot occur until liquidity is added.
- Transaction limits and taxes are applied post-launch to mitigate manipulation risks.

### **4. Observations and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                            | **Status**    | **Details**                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Front-Running Risk During Launch** | Mitigated     | Trading is disabled until the token is launched using the `isLaunched` flag. |
| **Role Assignment Validation**       | Safe          | Securely implemented using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl`.                   |
| **Manual Swap Function**             | As Intended   | Restricted to `MANAGER_ROLE` for operational flexibility.                    |
| **Taxes and Limits**                 | Correct       | Configurable by `MANAGER_ROLE`.                                              |
| **Event Emissions**                  | Comprehensive | Logs key actions for on-chain visibility.                                    |
| **Reentrancy Protection**            | Implemented   | Ensures safe handling of funds.                                              |

### **5. Launch and Operational Flow**

#### **Launch Process**

1. The `initialize` function sets up the token, including:

   - Role assignments.
   - Tax and limit configuration.
   - Creation of the Uniswap pair.

2. The `launch` function:
   - Transfers tokens to the contract.
   - Adds liquidity to the Uniswap pair.
   - Sets the `isLaunched` flag to enable trading.

#### **Transfer Mechanism**

1. Taxes and limits are enforced through the `_update` function:
   - Taxes are calculated based on the type of transaction (buy, sell, or transfer).
   - Limits are checked to ensure compliance with max transaction and wallet size.
2. Taxes collected are stored in the contract and swapped to ETH when the threshold is met.

---

### **6. Conclusion**

The SilkAI smart contract demonstrates a secure and efficient implementation of an ERC20 token with additional functionalities. All identified risks have been addressed or mitigated through robust design and the use of audited libraries.
