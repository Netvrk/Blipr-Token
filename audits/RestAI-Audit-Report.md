### Findings Summary

| Severity | Count | Status | Description |
|----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Critical | 0 | ‚úÖ All Fixed | No critical issues present |
| High | 1 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Open | Front-running vulnerability in launch |

## Remaining Findings

### High Severity

#### [H-01] Front-Running Vulnerability in Launch Function
**Status:** Open
**Location:** Lines 224-266

**Description:**
The launch function remains vulnerable to front-running attacks where bots can monitor the mempool and be the first buyers.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement initial trading cooldown
- Consider using commit-reveal pattern
- Add bot protection during launch phase

---

### Medium Severity

#### [M-01] No Slippage Protection in Liquidity Addition
**Status:** Open
**Location:** Lines 249-256

**Description:**
```solidity
swapRouter.addLiquidityETH{value: msg.value}(
    address(this),
    tokenAmount,
    0,  // No minimum token amount
    0,  // No minimum ETH amount
    operationsWallet,
    block.timestamp
);
```

**Impact:** Vulnerable to sandwich attacks during launch

**Recommendation:** Implement 95-98% minimum acceptable amounts

#### [M-02] Centralization Risk with MANAGER_ROLE
**Status:** Open
**Location:** Multiple functions

**Description:**
MANAGER_ROLE has extensive privileges without timelock or multisig requirements.

**Privileges:**
- Block/unblock addresses
- Modify taxes (up to 20%)
- Change trading limits
- Trigger manual swaps
- Set router address (pre-launch)

**Recommendation:** Implement timelock or multisig for sensitive operations

#### [M-03] MEV Vulnerability in Swap Function
**Status:** Open
**Location:** Lines 591-597

**Description:**
Swap uses `block.timestamp` and no minimum output amount.

**Recommendation:**
```solidity
uint256 minOutput = calculateMinOutput(balance);
swapRouter.swapExactTokensForETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
    balance,
    minOutput,  // Add minimum output
    path,
    address(this),
    block.timestamp + 300  // 5 minute deadline
);
```

#### [M-04] Gas Optimization in Batch Operations
**Status:** Open
**Location:** Lines 403-433

**Description:**
Batch operations could hit gas limits with 100 addresses.

**Recommendation:** Reduce limit to 50 addresses or implement pagination

---

### Low Severity

#### [L-01] Missing Event for Operations Wallet Update
**Location:** Line 370
**Recommendation:** Add `event OperationsWalletUpdated(address indexed newWallet);`

#### [L-02] Redundant Storage Reads
**Location:** Lines 321, 386
**Recommendation:** Cache `totalSupply()` value

#### [L-03] Inconsistent Access Control
**Location:** Various
**Recommendation:** Standardize role usage for similar operations

#### [L-04] Unlimited Approvals
**Location:** Lines 240, 589
**Recommendation:** Approve only required amounts

#### [L-05] Missing Zero Address Validation
**Location:** Initialize function
**Recommendation:** Validate `_ownerAddress` and `_operationsWallet`

---

### Informational

1. **Gas Optimizations Available**
   - Use `++i` instead of `i++` in loops
   - Cache array lengths before loops
   - Consider using `unchecked` blocks where safe

2. **Code Quality Enhancements**
   - Add comprehensive NatSpec documentation
   - Implement SafeERC20 for external token transfers
   - Add contract version constant

3. **Additional Security Patterns**
   - Consider implementing circuit breaker
   - Add rate limiting for sensitive functions
   - Implement gradual ownership renouncement

2. Slippage protection should be added for DEX operations
3. Centralization risks should be mitigated over time

### Deployment Recommendation: **READY FOR TESTNET**
**Mainnet deployment recommended after:**
- Implementing slippage protection
- Adding initial trading protection
- Establishing multisig/timelock for critical operations
