# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```

### Token Price

Token Total supply: 100,000,000
Added Liquidity:
Token: 100,000
WETH: 0.01
WETH in USD: 3445;
Price = 0.0003442

```txt
Calculate the Price of One Token
Value of WETH in USD = Amount of WETH * Price of WETH
Value of WETH in USD = 0.01 WETH * $3445/WETH = $34.45

Price of One Token = Value of WETH in USD / Tokens Added to Liquidity
Price of One Token = $34.45 / 100,000 tokens = $0.0003445 per token
```
