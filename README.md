### Token Price Calculations

```txt
- Token Total supply: 100,000,000
- Added Liquidity:
  Token: 100,000
  WETH: 0.01
- WETH in USD: 3445;
- Price = 0.0003442

Calculate the Price of One Token
Value of WETH in USD = Amount of WETH * Price of WETH
Value of WETH in USD = 0.01 WETH * $3445/WETH = $34.45

Price of One Token = Value of WETH in USD / Tokens Added to Liquidity
Price of One Token = $34.45 / 100,000 tokens = $0.0003445 per token
```
